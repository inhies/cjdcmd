cjdcmd
======

cjdcmd is a command line tool for interfacing with [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns), a mesh network routing engine designed for security, scalability, speed, and ease of use.

Installation
------------

cjdcmd is written in Go. If you already have Go installed, skip the next section.

### Install Go

To install go, check out the [install instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install) or, if you're lucky, you can do a quick install with the information below:

#### Ubuntu (and other Debian variants)

Ubuntu and other Debian variants can use apt to install:

	apt-get install golang

#### Mac OSX

If you have [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) installed:

    brew install go

If your system isn't listed above, perhaps you can [download pre-compiled binaries](http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads), otherwise you will have to [install from source](http://golang.org/doc/install/source).

#### Configure your folders (optional)

Next you should set up a special directory for all your go sourcecode and compiled programs. This is optional, however I recommend it because this will prevent you from having to use `sudo` every time you need to install an updated package or program. I will be giving a shortened version of the information found on [the official site](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#tmp_2)

First, make the folder where you want everything to be stored. I use the /home/inhies/projects/go but you may use whatever you like:

    $ mkdir -p $HOME/projects/go 

Next we need to tell our system where to look for Go packages and compiled programs. If you changed the folder name in the previous example, then make sure you change them here. You will want to add this to your `~/.profile` file or similar. On Ubuntu 12.10, I had to add it to my `~/.bashrc`:

	export GOPATH=$HOME/projects/go
	export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/projects/go/bin

Now, to make the changes take effect immediately, you can either run `$ source ~/.bashrc` or just paste those two lines you added to the file on your command line. You should now be setup! Try typing `$ echo $GOPATH` and make sure you see the folder you specified. If you have any problems, try re-reading the [official documentation](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#tmp_2).

### Install cjdcmd

Once you have Go installed, installing new programs and packages couldn't be easier. Simply run the following command to have cjdcmd download, build, and install:

    go get github.com/inhies/cjdcmd
	
If f you see no output from that command then everything worked with no errors. To verify that it was successful, run `cjdcmd` and see if it displays some information about the program. If it does you are done! cjdcmd has been downloaded, compiled, and installed. You amy now use it by typing `cjdcmd`.
	
**NOTE:** You may have to be root (use `sudo`) to install Go and cjdcmd.

Updating cjdcmd
---------------

To update your install of cjdcmd, simply run `go get -u github.com/inhies/cjdcmd` and it will automatically update, build, and install it. Just like when you initially installed cjdcmd, if you see no output from that command then everything worked with no errors.
	
Using cjdcmd
------------

Once you have cjdcmd installed you can run it without any arguments to get a list of commands or run it with the flag `--help` to get a list of all support options. Currently cjdcmd offers the following commands:
    
	ping  <cjdns IPv6 address, hostname, or cjdns path (obtained with route command)>
	route <cjdns IPv6 address, hostname, or cjdns path (obtained with route command)>
	traceroute <cjdns IPv6 address or hostname>
	log [-l level] [-file file] [-line line]
	peers
	dump
	kill

**NOTE:** if you don't specify the admin password in the flags then cjdcmd uses the cjdns configuration file to load the details needed to connect. It expects the file to be at `/etc/cjdroute.conf` however you can specify an alternate location with the `-f` or `--file` flags.

### Flags
	-c=0: 						[ping][traceroute] specify the number of packets to send (shorthand)
	-count=0: 					[ping][traceroute] specify the number of packets to send
	-f="/etc/cjdroute.conf": 	[all] the cjdroute.conf configuration file to use, edit, or view (shorthand)
	-file="/etc/cjdroute.conf": [all] the cjdroute.conf configuration file to use, edit, or view
	-l="DEBUG": 				[log] specify the logging level to use (shorthand)
	-level="DEBUG": 			[log] specify the logging level to use
	-line=0: 					[log] specify the cjdns source file line to log
	-logfile="": 				[log] specify the cjdns source file you wish to see log output from
	-p="": 						[all] specify the admin password (shorthand)
	-pass="": 					[all] specify the admin password
	-t=5000: 					[ping][traceroute] specify the time in milliseconds cjdns should wait for a response (shorthand)
	-timeout=5000: 				[ping][traceroute] specify the time in milliseconds cjdns should wait for a response

### Ping

Ping will send a cjdns ping packet to the specified node. Note that this is not the same as an ICMP ping packet like that which is sent with the `ping` and `ping6` utilities; it is a special cjdns switch-level packet. The node will reply with it's version which is the SHA1 hash of the git commit it was built on. 

#### Sample Output

	$cjdcmd ping -c 4 -t 800 fcf9:11b1:c252:6176:0550:0c59:2bb5:229a
	Attempting to connect to cjdns...Connected

	Target is using cjdns version d2b1f95ebf39411c37430b7adbd2e76bcc3ad6b6

### Route

Route will either print out all known routes to a specified IPv6 address or the IPv6 address of the node at the end of a specified path. It also displays a human-readable representation of cjdns link quality, which is what the router uses to determine which specific path to take.

Route is useful because it shows you the many different paths that are available to get to one end node. You can then take each of those paths and use the ping command to check for connectivity. This will be further exapnded upon in the future with a `traceroute` command.

#### Sample Output

With an IPv6 address:

	$cjdcmd route fcf9:11b1:c252:6176:0550:0c59:2bb5:229a
	Attempting to connect to cjdns...Connected

Or with a path:	

	$cjdcmd route 0000.0000.0000.001f
	Attempting to connect to cjdns...Connected
	IP: fcf9:11b1:c252:6176:0550:0c59:2bb5:229a -- Version: 1 -- Path: 0000.0000.0000.001f -- Link: 400

### Traceroute

Traceroute will take all the possible routes to a specific target and then ping each known hop along the way. This will display exactly the path your packets take through the network along any given path.

#### Sample Output

	$cjdcmd traceroute fcf9:11b1:c252:6176:0550:0c59:2bb5:229a
	Attempting to connect to cjdns...Connected

### Log

Log will begin outputting log information from cjdns. You can optionally specify which level of information to receive which is either Debug, Info, Warn, Error,  or Critical. It also allows you to filter by a specific source code file or a specific line number from the source code. You can use any combination of these options to get the output that you desire. 

#### Sample Output:

	$cjdcmd log
	Attempting to connect to cjdns...Connected
	1 1357729794 DEBUG Ducttape.c:347 Got running session ver[1] send[12] recv[7] ip[fcd6:b2a5:e3cc:d78d:fc69:a90f:4bf7:4a02]

	5 1357729795 DEBUG CryptoAuth.c:568 No traffic in [76] seconds, resetting connection.

### Peers

Peers will list the peers you are directly connected to. This will show both other nodes you connect with and nodes that connect to you. 

#### Sample Output

	$cjdcmd peers
	Attempting to connect to cjdns...Connected
	Finding all connected peers

### Dump

Dump will print the routing table to stdout, complete with IPv6 of the target node, the path to that node (which can be used with the ping command), and human-readable cjdns link quality. Only working paths with a link quality greater than 0 are shown.

#### Sample Output:

	$cjdcmd dump

### Kill

Kill will tell cjdns to shutdown and exit. 

#### Sample Output:

	$cjdcmd kill
	Attempting to connect to cjdns...Connected
	cjdns is shutting down...
	

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Config File

The default configuration file format has changed numerous times, and as such cjdcmd will probably throw an error if you try to use it with an older version of cjdns. Cjdns also allows the use of grossly out of spec JSON without throwing an error which is fine for cjdns but when other programs try to parse the file it causes issues. 

The current format that cjdcmd supports can be found the [configuration file guide](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/rfcs/configure.md) at the cjdns github. The notable changes between what you might have and what is expected are:

* Ensure there are `[` and `]` in the `"UDPInterface"` and `"ETHInterface"` sections, which you can find an example of [here](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/rfcs/configure.md#connection-interfaces.)
* Ensure there are commas after each `{"password":"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"}` section, except the last, like [here](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/rfcs/configure.md#incoming-connections) where they are commented out. For example:

	````{"password":"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"},
	{"password":"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"},
	{"password":"012345678901234567890123456789"}````
